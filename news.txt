When Yared Agonafer, an Ethiopian gold and silver merchant, set out to buy a car five years ago, he settled quickly on the model: a 1977
Volkswagen Beetle. The low price was its main draw, but nostalgia motivated him too.

“My father had a Beetle when I was a kid,” says Yared, who recalls being ferried to school and family parties in the car. “Whenever I drive
mine, I have these memories. I love it.”
